DESCRIPTION
===========

This app is developed with the intent of helping any Christian believer during his devotions.

4 Main aspects:

- A Daily Verse of encouragement which is randomly picked from an internet ressource. If it happens that the user does not have an internet connection active, the app pick the latest persisted verse.
- A quick search option: For a Bible reader, one might want to quickly search for a verse for which he/she knows some keywords. The app searches all relevant verses and renders them on a tableview. A detail view allows to view fully the verse.
- Bible Study: Using the bibletalk.tv API, a resourceful set of materials is provided with a series of lessons on different topics.
- Bible in a Year: A 365 days Bible reading plan is provided with required texts of each day. Once a user completes the reading, he/she checks the reading as read. Progress is persisted locally to the device as the user can continue the next time from where he/she stopped. Jumping days is not allowed. A user can reset the progress and restart the reading.
